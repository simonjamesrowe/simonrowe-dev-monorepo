# Specification Quality Checklist: Blog Post Series - Rebuilding simonrowe.dev with AI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec is content-focused (blog posts) rather than system-feature-focused, so the requirements centre on content creation, storage, and discoverability within the existing blog infrastructure.
- The Blog Post Content Plan section provides detailed outlines for each post, derived directly from the project's commit history.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed as the commit history and existing blog system provide sufficient context to make informed decisions.
